# JavaScript DSA Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to my JavaScript DSA Challenge! This journey is designed to learn Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through engaging and creative web applications. Each day, I'll be working on a new project to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. This repository serves as a record of my daily progress as I build various projects from scratch to enhance my understanding of programming concepts using JavaScript.

## üåü [Day -1: Role Playing Game](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Role%20Playing%20Game)

### Overview üìú

In this initial practice project, I've decided to create a Role Playing Game (RPG). An RPG is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.

The goal of this project is to learn and reinforce fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by crafting my RPG from scratch. Throughout this project, I will be working with a variety of concepts, including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements

By developing an RPG, I aim to not only enhance my coding skills but also to create a dynamic and interactive experience that incorporates the essence of storytelling within a game.

## üåü [Day -2: Calorie Counter](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Calorie%20Counter)
### Overview üìú
In the Day 2 project, I extended my coding practice by creating a Calorie Counter application. The purpose of this project is to apply and reinforce fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript while building a dynamic and interactive Calorie Counter.
Throughout this project, I will be working with a variety of concepts, including:

### 1. User Input Validation
**Purpose:** Ensure valid user input.

**Key Concepts:**
- Regular Expressions
- Input Sanitization

### 2. Dynamic Interface Update
**Purpose:** Provide real-time feedback to users.

**Key Concepts:**
- DOM Manipulation
- Template Literals

### 3. Event Handling
**Purpose:** Respond to user interactions.

**Key Concepts:**
- addEventListener()
- Event Object

### 4. Calculations and Logic
**Purpose:** Derive meaningful results from user input.

**Key Concepts:**
- Mathematical Operations
- Conditional Statements

### 5. Clearing Form and Resetting State
**Purpose:** Allow users to start fresh.

**Key Concepts:**
- Reset Function
- Class Manipulation

### 6. Interactive Web Application
**Purpose:** Develop a user-friendly application.

**Key Concepts:**
- CSS Styling
- User Feedback

### 7. Practical Application of JavaScript Concepts
**Purpose:** Apply fundamental JavaScript concepts.

**Key Concepts:**
- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements

### 8. Web Application Flow
**Purpose:** Define a logical flow for the application.

**Key Concepts:**
- Sequence of Actions

### 9. Alerts and Error Handling
**Purpose:** Inform users and handle errors.

**Key Concepts:**
- alert()
- Error Flags
  
### Day-2 Project Output
The Calorie Counter application allows users to input their daily calorie budget, and track calories consumed during breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and calories burned through exercise. The application calculates the remaining calories and provides a summary of the user's budget, consumed calories, and burned calories.

 ## üåü [Day -3: Music Player](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Music%20Player)

### Overview üìú
In the Day 3 project, I will be creating a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project will cover essential string and array methods like `find()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, and `join()`. These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Handling audio playback
- Managing a playlist
- Implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities
- Dynamically updating the user interface based on the current song
