# JavaScript DSA Challenge
Welcome to my JavaScript DSA Challenge! This journey is designed  to learn Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through engaging and creative web applications. Each day, I'll be working on a new project every day to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript.This repository serves as a record of my daily progress as I build various projects from scratch to enhance my understanding of programming concepts using JavaScript.

## [Day -1: Role Playing Game](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Role%20Playing%20Game)

### Overview

In this initial practice project, I've decided to create a Role Playing Game. The goal is to learn and reinforce fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by crafting my RPG from scratch. Throughout this project, I will be working with a variety of concepts, including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements
