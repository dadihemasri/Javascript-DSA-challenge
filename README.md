# JavaScript DSA Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript DSA Challenge! This journey is designed to learn Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through engaging and creative web applications. Each day, I'll be working on a new project to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. This repository serves as a record of my daily progress as I build various projects from scratch to enhance my understanding of programming concepts using JavaScript.

## 🌟 [Day -1: Role Playing Game](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Role%20Playing%20Game)

### Overview 📜

In this initial practice project, I've decided to create a Role Playing Game (RPG). An RPG is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.

The goal of this project is to learn and reinforce fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by crafting my RPG from scratch. Throughout this project, I will be working with a variety of concepts, including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements

By developing an RPG, I aim to not only enhance my coding skills but also to create a dynamic and interactive experience that incorporates the essence of storytelling within a game.

## 🌟 [Day -4: Date Formatter](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Date%20Formatter)

### Overview 📜

In the Day 4 project, I focused on working with dates in JavaScript, tackling the challenges of navigating various methods, formats, and time zones. The goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. Additionally, I aimed to master the art of correctly formatting dates.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- JavaScript Date object
- Date methods: getDate(), getMonth(), getFullYear()
- Formatting dates
- Handling time zones

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. Getting Current Date
I used the JavaScript Date object to get the current date, including the day, month, and year.

```javascript
const currentDate = new Date();
const day = currentDate.getDate();
const month = currentDate.getMonth() + 1; // Note: Months are zero-based
const year = currentDate.getFullYear();
```

## 🌟 [Day -5: Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/dadihemasri/Javascript-DSA-challenge/tree/main/Palindrome%20Checker)

### Overview 📜

In the Day 5 project, I tackled the Palindrome Checker challenge, building a web application to determine whether a given input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- String Manipulation
- Conditional Statements
- DOM Manipulation

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. String Manipulation
I employed various string manipulation techniques to remove non-alphanumeric characters, convert all characters to the same case, and check for palindromes.

#### 2. Conditional Statements
Utilizing conditional statements, I determined whether the input is a palindrome or not and updated the user interface accordingly.

#### 3. DOM Manipulation
The results were dynamically displayed on the webpage using DOM manipulation, providing real-time feedback to the user.
