# JavaScript DSA Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript DSA Challenge! This journey is designed to learn Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through engaging and creative web applications. Each day, I'll be working on a new project to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. This repository serves as a record of my daily progress as I build various projects from scratch to enhance my understanding of programming concepts using JavaScript.

## 🌟 [Day -1: Role Playing Game](https://dadihemasri.github.io/Role-Playing-game/)

### Overview 📜

In this initial practice project, I've decided to create a Role Playing Game (RPG). An RPG is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.

The goal of this project is to learn and reinforce fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by crafting my RPG from scratch. Throughout this project, I will be working with a variety of concepts, including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements

By developing an RPG, I aim to not only enhance my coding skills but also to create a dynamic and interactive experience that incorporates the essence of storytelling within a game.
